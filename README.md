# Ramda with Tree Shaking

## Webpack

Starting from version `0.25` Ramda comes with Tree Shaking.

The idea behind [Tree Shaking in Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) is next:<br/>
**Webpack marks the unused code and some minifier removes it**.

Minifier options:
* `UglifyJSPlugin`
* flag in Webpack `--optimize-minimize` that includes the `UglifyJSPlugin` behind the scenes
* flag in Webpack `-p` that invokes `--optimize-minimize flag` and `--define process.env.NODE_ENV="'production'"`

You can find a basic example in the folder `01-webpack-ramda-tree-shaking`
that uses `UglifyJSPlugin` as a minifier.

Note, that in the `webpack.config.js` file `UglifyJSPlugin` is initiated only for production mode:
minification and tree shaking are time-consuming operations and in the most cases you won't
do them in development mode.

Run the next command to compile files in development mode:<br/>
`$ npm run build`

Run the next command to compile files in production mode:<br/>
`$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build`

### How to check Tree Shaking works?

You can search in dist files for some string from Ramda sources.
For example, `splitEvery` function contains an exception with a message:
`First argument to splitEvery must be a positive integer`.

Try to do next:
* compile `01-webpack-ramda-tree-shaking/src/index.js`in development mode
  (function `splitEvery` is not used in this example) and
  search for that exceptional message – you should find it in the dist file
* compile the same file in production mode and you should not find it

### How much profit from Tree Shaking in Ramda?

Let's compare the dist files compiled in the production mode for `ramda@0.25` and
`ramda@0.24`.
Files `01-webpack-ramda-tree-shaking/src/index.js` and
`02-webpack-ramda-without-tree-shaking/src/index.js` accordingly.

Both files have the same code and use only one Ramda function – `identity`.
They are compiled into files with the next sizes:<br/>
`ramda@0.24` - 59.2 kB <br/>
`ramda@0.25` - 51.3 kB

**With Tree Shaking file size is reduced only by 15%**.
Remember, we used only one function, so it looks like the maximum profit.

Comparing to the to the **manual Tree Shaking**, when the size of the dist file is 957 bytes,
that is **reducing by 98.5%**!

Example of the manual Tree Shaking:<br/>
`03-webpack-ramda-manual-tree-shaking/src/index.js`

### Nasty bug in Tree Shaking in Webpack

Not only that Tree Shaking in Ramda doesn't give a big profit,
but [this bug in Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4453)
makes the situation even worse.

Quick overview:<br/>
Two files import `ramda`.<br/>
File `a.js` imports function `a`, file `b.js` function `b`.<br/>
In the result, bundle `a.js` will have both functions, as well as bundle `b.js`.

That means that ALL Ramda functions you use in your project
will be added to ALL bundles that import Ramda.

Check the example in `04-webpack-tree-shaking-bug`.

### ModuleConcatenationPlugin

[ModuleConcatenationPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/)
concatenates the scope of all modules into one closure and allows for the code to have
a faster execution time in the browser.

Besides, in the scope hoisted bundle it is more easily to eliminate a dead code.
Check the example in the folder `06-webpack-scope-hoisted`:<br/>
the resulting bundle size is **2.45 kB**.

[Note from Andarist](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/2355#issuecomment-338661857)
> Keep in mind that ModuleConcatenationPlugin is considered
experimental at this point (i think, maybe its already past that phase).
 Im not sure how well it plays with code-splitted project, but Im using it without any problems with a single bundle app.


### `babel-present-env`

If you use `babel-preset-env` make sure to set option `modules` to false,
otherwise, Tree Shaking won't work.

The full example you can find in the folder `05-webpack-tree-shaking-and-babel-preset-env`.

If you rely on configuration merging in babel, there is a bug
in `babel-preset-env`. Check [this issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/6607)
to see how to solve it.

### `compress` option in UglifyJSPlugin

A bundle can be reduced even more by passing `{compress: {passes: 3}}`
to `UglifyJSPlugin`.

In example #1 the result is not that impressive:<br/>
the size is decreased from 51.3 kB to 51.1 kB.

Meantime in example #6, the bundle with `compress` option is reduced more than twice:
from 2.45 kB to 1.03 kB.

### `babel-plugin-ramda`

The [`babel-plugin-ramda`](https://github.com/megawac/babel-plugin-ramda) plugin can be used to transform Ramda imports into manually cherry-picked methods. Using the plugin in this way results in production mode being 952 bytes. This is the smallest bundle size that can be achieved when using webpack and babel.

The plugin does not play nicely with some other plugins such as [`babel-plugin-rewire`](https://github.com/speedskater/babel-plugin-rewire) that are useful in test, so you can choose to only enable it for specific environments as shown in the `.babelrc` config file for example #8.

## Rollup

The same Ramda example was built with Rollup – `08-rollup-ramda-tree-shaking`.
The resulting bundle in production mode was only **530 bytes**!
